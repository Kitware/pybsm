# pyBSM

pyBSM is a Python-based tool for sensor modeling. It provides common components
useful for simulating the image formation process through different imaging
systems.

This repo builds off of the work done by LeMaster and Eismann in creating the
original pyBSM package for modeling image systems [1] as well as LeMaster, et
al. in their work in validating the pyBSM package [2].

NOTE: A set of functions which infer OTFs from user data has been removed from
the current distribution of pyBSM. They are archived under the v0.7.0 tag if
they are needed.

## Installation

`pybsm` installation has been tested on Unix and Linux systems.

To install the current version via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pybsm[<extra1>,<extra2>,...]
```

To install the current version via `conda-forge`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pybsm
```

Certain plugins may require additional runtime dependencies. Details on these
requirements can be found
[here](https://pybsm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### Developer Tools

Ensure the source tree is acquired locally before proceeding.

#### Poetry Install

You can install using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

> [!IMPORTANT] pyBSM currently requires `poetry<2.0`

> [!WARNING] Users unfamiliar with Poetry should use caution. See
> [installation documentation](https://pybsm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#from-source)
> for more information.

```bash
poetry install --with main,linting,tests,docs --extras "<extra1> <extra2> ..."
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks ensure that code complies with required linting and formatting
guidelines. These hooks run automatically before commits but can also be
executed manually. To bypass checks during a commit, use the `--no-verify` flag.

To install and use pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
poetry install --sync --with main,linting,tests,docs
# Initialize pre-commit hooks for the repository
poetry run pre-commit install
# Run pre-commit checks on all files
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
