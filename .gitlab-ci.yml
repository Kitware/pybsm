# Job to test-run the example jupyter notebooks
#
# This job has a parallel matrix to parameterize different working-directories
# and notebooks within to run. Each parallel instance of this job should only
# run a single notebook. !reference:
#
# See GitLab docs for parallel-matrix functionality:
#   https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#parallelmatrix
#
# The parallel-matrix list may have multiple items, and each entry should have
# a pair of keys: "NOTEBOOK_DIR" and "NOTEBOOK_FILE". (Given the documentation
# for the parallel-matrix functionality, combinatorics are only applied within
# an item, not across items.)
# * "NOTEBOOK_DIR" should be a single string that notes the directory in which
#   notebook files should be run in (basically the working directory, generally
#   the directory the notebook lives in). This path should be relative to the
#   root of the repository.
# * "NOTEBOOK_FILE" should be a list of strings that denote the notebook files
#   to be run. These paths path should be relative to the "NOTEBOOK_DIR". Files
#   in this list will be combinatorially combined with the path provided in
#   the associated "NOTEBOOK_DIR" to create a job parameterization instance.
