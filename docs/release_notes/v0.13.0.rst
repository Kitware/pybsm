0.13.0
======

Introduces an extensible image simulation framework with new ImageSimulator base and derived classes, supporting both
individual and composite degradations. Documentation and examples were expanded to include default configuration
guidance, UAV simulation settings, and additional useful calculations. Repository-wide test fixtures for
floating-point comparisons were also added.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

* Added ABC ``ImageSimulator`` class and child classes to simulate individual and composite degradations.

* Created an example jupyter notebook, ``image_simulation_example.ipynb``, to demonstrate how to simulate images.

* Added ``docs/default_configs.rst`` which explains the default config reasoning and setup.

* Added ``docs/miscellaneous/uav_default_config.json`` for the default configuration.

* Expanded ``docs/useful_calculations.rst`` to include new calculations that are useful to users.
