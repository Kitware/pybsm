v0.10.0
=======

Swapped out ``opencv`` function calls with equivalent calls already supported by
other dependencies. This allowed the removal of the ``opencv-python`` and
``opencv-python-headless`` dependency bifurcation. Allso added a custom ``syrupy``
comparator to better handle "close-enough" known-state regression.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

Tests

* Added custom syrupy comparator allowing for tolerance in float and numpy
  array comparisons

Code Refactor

* Refactored codebase to replace ``cv2`` based functions with ``scipy``
  and ``matplotlib`` alternatives.
