0.14.0
======

This release focuses on performance optimization of OTF functions using numba,
adds GSD-based image resampling controls, removes altitude limits on the
atmospheric database, and exposes additional sensor parameters.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

* Optomized OTF functions and ``ImageSimulator`` to improve execution time.

* Added a flag for explicitly enabling/disabling image resampling based on GSD.

* Updated OTF tests to reflect changes in OTF functions.

* Removed the upper bound on altitude for the atmospheric database.

* Added two tests to check the bounds on the ground range for the atmospheric database.

* Added two tests to check the bounds on the altitude for the atmospheric database.

* Exposed ``qe``, ``qe_wavelengths``, ``filter_kernel`` and ``frame_stacks``

Fixes
-----

* ``Sensor`` test now correctly compares ``opt_trans_wavelengths``.
